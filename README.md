NUPT-FPV: A multimodal dataset based on fingerprint and finger vein <br>

Paper: A Dataset and Benchmark for Multimodal Biometric Recognition Based on Fingerprint and Finger Vein

## Short Information
NUPT-FPV obtained 840 finger information from 140 volunteers, each finger was collected 20 times (collected in two sessions), and 33600 fingerprint and finger vein images were obtained (Each subject provided the index, middle and ring fingers of the left and right hands). It is collected by Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(NJUPT). Any one or group is allowed to use this database free of charge.

Among these subjects, including 108 males and 32 females, the average age was 19.3 years. The minimum age was 16 years old and the maximum age was 29 years old.

During the collection, the collection device was placed on a 1 m high table and the subjects were asked to sit within 0.2-0.5 m in front of the collection device and put their fingers in. Between each collection interval, subjects needed to remove their fingers from the collection device and then put them back in again to ensure the diversity of data. At the same time, the subjects were asked to be in a relaxed state, allowing slight tilt, offset and pressing when putting their fingers in to restore the real scene as much as possible.



`Statistics description of the proposed NUPT-FPV dataset`
| Data | Subjects | Finger | Repetitions | Session | Size | Total |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Fingerprint | 140 | 6 | 10 | 2 | 300*400 | 16800 |
| Finger Vein | 140 | 6 | 10 | 2 | 300*400 | 16800 |
